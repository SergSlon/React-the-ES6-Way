#ReactJS the ES6 Way

Welcome to ReactJS, the ES6 way! My name is Darin Haener, and I'll be taking you on a whirlwind introductory tour of ReactJS, and as the course name suggests, we'll be doing it the ES6 way!

React is a unique JavaScript library in that it is only the "V" in MVC. Meaning that it is only used on the View layer in web applications. This allows it to be narrowly focused on doing one thing and doing it well.

React uses many innovative technologies to create a fast, modular, and easy to use interface library.
