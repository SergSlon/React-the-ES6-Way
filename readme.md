# ReactJS the ES6 Way

Welcome to ReactJS, the ES6 way! My name is Darin Haener, and I'll be taking
you on a whirlwind introductory tour of ReactJS, and as the course name
suggests, we'll be doing it the ES6 way!

React is a unique JavaScript framework in that it is *only* the "V" in MVC.
Meaning that it is only used on the "View" layer in web applications. This
allows it to be narrowly focused on doing one thing and doing it well.

React uses many innovative technologies to create a fast, modular, and
easy to use framework. 

## The Virtual DOM

This is one term you'll hear thrown around a lot in the React community,
and it is what React uses to make page updates blazing fast and efficient.
We'll be discussing this in more detail later.

## ES6

Hopefully, if you're taking this course, you've made yourself at least a little
bit familiar with the newest JavaScript specification call ECMAScript 2015,
or ES6 for short. We'll be using ES6 to create our React components in this
class, because it's awesome, and makes programming in JavaScript even more
fun. 

Because it's not fully supported in browsers just yet, we'll have to use
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile our code down to browser friendly
ES5.

Buckle up and get ready for some React and ES6 awesomeness!
